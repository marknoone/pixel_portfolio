                    I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Is this my espresso machine? 
                    Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump 
                    toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this 
                    planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

                    You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You really think you can 
                    fly that thing? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but John, if The 
                    Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. God help us, 
                    we're in the hands of engineers.

                    Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Checkmate... Do you have any idea how 
                    long it takes those cups to decompose. Do you have any idea how long it takes those 
                    cups to decompose. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Life finds a way. I gave it a cold? 
                    I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

                    I was part of something special. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste,

                    Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. 
                    A computer virus. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out 
                    of here! What do they got in there? King Kong? Yes, Yes, without the oops! I was part
